      Word to your object mother.
    </div>

    <p>h1. fixjour

Another fixture replacement. Gets you some methods (@new_*@, @create_*@ and
@valid_*_attributes@) methods and some confidence.

h2. The focus of this project is liberation through constraints.

It uses the bits of object mother systems that worked well for
me in the past, and actively discourages the bits that have caused
me pain.

The constraints:

h4. One builder per model

If you try to define a builder more than once per model, you'll
run into a @Fixjour::RedundantBuilder@ error. One builder per
model decreases confusion.

h4. No redundant object creation methods

If you try to define a method that's already been defined by
a Fixjour builder, you'll run into a @Fixjour::RedundantBuilder@
error. If you find the need to alter the behavior of a builder
for a particular set of tests, you should just wrap the creation
methods defined by Fixjour, preferably with a name that describes
how the new method is different from the Fixjour method.

h4. Processing the overrides hash is bad

If you want to mess with the overrides hash that can be passed
into any of the creation methods, you must use the @process@
method (see below). To enforce this, the @delete@ method is actually
private for the overrides hash.

h2. What it gets you:

With this setup:

<pre>
Fixjour do
  define_builder(Person) do |klass, overrides|
    klass.new(:name => 'Pat', :age => 22)
  end
end

include Fixjour
</pre>

You get:

h3. @new_person(overrides={})@

The @new_person@ method basically just returns the result
of your builder block, which should *always return an unsaved
instance of the model class*. You can pass it overrides in a
hash like so: @new_person(:name => nil)@.

h3. @create_person(overrides={})@

The @create_person@ method calls @new_person@, passing in any
overrides you pass it, calls @save!@ on the result, and returns
the saved object.

h3. @valid_person_attributes(overrides={})@

The @valid_person_attributes@ returns a hash of valid person
attributes that are derived from the @new_person@ method, and
ideal for things like testing controllers. It can also take
attribute override options like so: @valid_person_attributes(:name => nil)@.

h2. Usage:

You specify builder sets for your ActiveRecord models in a
@Fixjour@ block using the @define_builder@ helper, which can
be used in one of two ways:

h3. Using a builder block

Pass @define_builder@ a model class for which you want a new set
of creation methods, and a block which returns a new valid
model object. The block will be passed two arguments: a proxy
object for your class, and an overrides hash. If you call @new@
on the class proxy, it will return a new instance of the class,
with whatever attributes you specify as defaults. It will also
automatically merge any override options in all of the methods
generated by Fixjour.

Example:

<pre>
define_builder(Person) do |klass, overrides|
  klass.new(:name => "Pat", :age => 22)
end
</pre>

If you want to process an option in the overrides hash, you can use
the @process@ method:

<pre>
define_builder(Person) do |klass, overrides|
  overrides.process(:child) do |is_child|
    overrides[:age] = 14 if is_child
  end
  
  klass.new(:name => "Pat", :age => 22)
end

# the default
person = new_person
person.age # => 22

# using the override
person = new_person(:child => true)
person.age  # => 14
</pre>

In the above example, the @:child@ key will be deleted from the @overrides@
hash and made available as the @is_child@ block argument where you can handle
things accordingly.

*Note:* The @delete@ method is private on the overrides hash passed into the
builder block. This is meant to encourage you to only use the @process@ method
instead. Why? First, because processing the overrides hash is a smell. Deal
with it. Second, using the @process@ method provides some indication to readers
that you're screwing with the overrides hash, and that's a good thing.

h4. @attr_protected@ fields

If you have fields that cannot be mass-assigned, use the @protected@ helper:

  define_builder(Article) do |klass, overrides|
    klass.protected :author
    klass.new :title => "The title", :body => "good", :author => new_user
  end

If you use the @protected@ helper to declare @attr_protected@ fields, you can
then treat them the same as any other field in your test methods.

h4. With Associations

To specify an associated object, you can call that object's @new_*@ method:

<pre>
Fixjour do
  define_builder(Post) do |klass, overrides|
    klass.new(:name => 'a post', :body => 'texted')
  end
  
  define_builder(Comment) do |klass, overrides|
    klass.new(:body => 'Oh ok!', :post => new_post)
  end
end

include Fixjour

new_comment.post.name # => 'a post'
</pre>

Note that it's never a good idea to use a @create_*@ method in a
build block.

h3. Verifying your setups

Fixjour requires more work on your part, so it also includes a way
to verify that your creation methods are behaving the way they should.
Call @Fixjour.verify!@ to ensure the following things:

# Creation methods are returning valid objects by default.
# @new_*@ methods are returning new records.
# @new_*@ and @create_*@ methods return instances of the correct class.

h3. Recommended usage with RSpec and Cucumber

If you want to use Fixjour with RSpec and Cucumber you probably want to avoid adding the builder methods onto Object directly.  To do this you should first create a file where your Fixjour builder definitions can live.  Say for example you put it at spec/fixjour_builders.rb.  To take advantage of these builders from RSpec use the following code in your spec_helper.rb:

<pre>
require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/fixjour_builders.rb")

Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
  config.include(Fixjour) # This will add the builder methods to your ExampleGroups and not pollute Object
  ...
end
</pre>

To use the same builders in Cucumber you simply need to include Fixjour into your Wolrd object from features/support/env.rb:

<pre>
require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) +'/../../spec/fixjour_builders.rb')
World { |world| world.extend(Fixjour) }
</pre>

Be sure to do this after you define your World object.  So, if you are using Rails you should include Fixjour after you require 'cucumber/rails/world'.
